This directory lists some ADR templates. Note that **the original** ADR format is created by Michael Nygard and is built into talo. It's also included here (as `adr.md`) in case you want to make modifications.

The other templates are copied from Joel Parker Henderson's [architecture-decision-record](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record) repository.
